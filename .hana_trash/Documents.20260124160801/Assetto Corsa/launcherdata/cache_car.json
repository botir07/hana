The first cars have been delivered to private BMW teams, who will prepare them for use in various national and international championships.\u003c/br\u003e\u003c/br\u003e\r\n\r\nThe largest difference between production and racing car can be found under the bonnet: while the production version of the BMW Z4 is driven by a six-cylinder engine, the GT3 car is powered by a 4.0-litre eight-cylinder engine similar to the unit used in the BMW M3 GT2. This powerful heart produces over 500 bhp. Its excellent performance characteristics and good torque curve make the base engine from the production version of the BMW M3 predestined for use in motorsport.\u003c/br\u003e\u003c/br\u003e\r\n\t\r\nThe fitting of the V8 engine had a considerable influence on the development of the BMW Z4 GT3. Initially, design-space examinations were performed using CATIA V5 design software, in order to place the engine in the ideal position and meet racing specifications. The engineers then added all the other components.\u003c/br\u003e\u003c/br\u003e\r\n\t\r\nWhen it comes to electronics, the private teams can look forward to innovative BMW solutions, which have already been tried and tested on the BMW M3 GT2: the modern ECU408 takes over the engine management, while the Power400 electronic control unit is responsible for controlling all the actuators. The power is transmitted through a six-speed, sequential gearbox with \u0026ldquo;Quick Shift\u0026rdquo; function.\u003c/br\u003e\u003c/br\u003e\r\n\t\r\nThe front axle of the BMW Z4 GT3 is a completely new design, based on a series concept. It is equipped with a tubular stabiliser bar with adjustable blades. The rear axle is designed as a longitudinal link axle, as with the series version of the BMW Z4. During the development, BMW Motorsport engineers worked hand in hand in other areas with their colleagues from series production. This allowed them to access calculations from the field of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) when designing the car\u0027s aerodynamics. Furthermore, tests were also carried out in the wind tunnel and on the BMW Group\u0027s test benches.\u003c/br\u003e\u003c/br\u003e\r\n\r\nFront and rear wings, bonnet, roof, fender and many other components are made of carbon fibre reinforced plastics (CFRP). Using this lightweight, torsion-resistant material contributed significantly to reducing the weight of the BMW Z4 GT3 to 1,200 kilograms.\r\n\tAs with all cars in the BMW customer racing range, the emphasis was also put on cost-efficiency when developing the BMW Z4 GT3. As a result, the car offers a very good cost/performance ratio and gives private teams the opportunity to participate in affordable motorsport at the highest level.","tags":["#GTE-GT3","rwd","race","sequential","gt","gt3","germany"],"class":"race","specs":{"bhp":"530bhp","torque":"520Nm","weight":"1265kg","topspeed":"280+km/h","acceleration":"--s 0-100","pwratio":"2.38kg/hp","range":182},"torqueCurve":[["0","0"],["500","142"],["1000","223"],["1500","281"],["2000","322"],["2500","339"],["3000","369"],["3500","398"],["4000","422"],["4500","457"],["5000","457"],["5500","464"],["6000","482"],["6500","480"],["7000","475"],["7500","469"],["8000","454"],["8500","407"],["8750","401"]],"powerCurve":[["0","0"],["500","12"],["1000","31"],["1500","59"],["2000","90"],["2500","119"],["3000","155"],["3500","196"],["4000","237"],["4500","289"],["5000","321"],["5500","358"],["6000","406"],["6500","438"],["7000","467"],["7500","494"],["8000","510"],["8500","486"],["8750","493"]],"path":"file:///C:/Program%20Files%20(x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/assettocorsa/content/cars/bmw_z4_gt3","id":"bmw_z4_gt3","badge":"file:///C:/Program%20Files%20(x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/assettocorsa/content/cars/bmw_z4_gt3/ui/badge.png","dlc":false,"skins":["0_bmw_motorsport_2013_black","assetto_z","bmw_motorsport_2012","bmw_motorsport_2013_white","fanatec","marc_vds_2013","scuderia_ecosse","tcr_2014_097","tcr_2014_903","vita4one","walkenhorst_motorsport","xdrive_20_z"],"skinmeta":{"0_bmw_motorsport_2013_black":{"skinName":null,"driverName":null,"country":null,"number":null,"team":null},"assetto_z":{"skinName":null,"driverName":null,"country":null,"number":null,"team":null},"bmw_motorsport_2012":{"skinName":null,"driverName":null,"country":null,"number":null,"team":null},"bmw_motorsport_2013_white":{"skinName":null,"driverName":null,"country":null,"number":null,"team":null},"fanatec":{"skinName":null,"driverName":null,"country":null,"number":null,"team":null},"marc_vds_2013":{"skinName":null,"driverName":null,"country":null,"number":null,"team":null},"scuderia_ecosse":{"skinName":null,"driverName":null,"country":null,"number":null,"team":null},"tcr_2014_097":{"skinName":null,"driverName":null,"country":null,"number":null,"team":null},"tcr_2014_903":{"skinName":null,"driverName":null,"country":null,"number":null,"team":null},"vita4one":{"skinName":null,"driverName":null,"country":null,"number":null,"team":null},"walkenhorst_motorsport":{"skinName":null,"driverName":null,"country":null,"number":null,"team":null},"xdrive_20_z":{"skinName":null,"driverName":null,"country":null,"number":null,"team":null}}},"bmw_z4_s1":{"name":"BMW Z4 E89 Step1","parent":"bmw_z4","brand":"BMW","description":"The Step1 tuned version of Z4 E89 35is series has non adjustable aftermarket dampers and lowered springs.

The car is also more powerful than before (750 CV) and weighs 35 kg less.\u003c/br\u003e\u003c/br\u003e\r\n\r\n\tThe key to the aero package is the active rear wing design which represents a new aerodynamic concept called \u0027opening gap\u0027. The wing features two flaps, with profiles similar to those used in Formula 1, which rotate electronically to adjust the downforce between the front and rear axles in function of vehicle speed and the manoeuvre being effected. The result of this concept is better performance in cornering.\u003c/br\u003e\u003c/br\u003e\r\n\r\n\tThe 599XX active rear wing is actuated automatically according to specific parameters which are integrated with the car\u0027s other control functions (ESP, ABS, SCM and F1-Trac). As a result of this integration, all the electronic controls have been suitably recalibrated. The \u0027opening gap\u0027 system logic is based on the following parameters:\u003c/br\u003e\r\n\t- steering wheel angle\u003c/br\u003e\r\n\t- longitudinal acceleration\u003c/br\u003e\r\n\t- lateral acceleration\u003c/br\u003e\r\n\t- vehicle speed\u003c/br\u003e\r\n\r\n\tThe new aerodynamics package for the 599XX also includes a modified front splitter and a new rear diffuser featuring a larger surface area and redesigned fences and foot-plates.

As a result of being built by hand, each model differs from the others for some details.\r\n\tThe car has 13-inch Campagnolo magnesium wheels, the fronts eight and the rears nine inches wide; there are Girling disc brakes on all four corners, the rear ones are inboard.

The engine delivers 510 hp and 600 Nm of torque between 2500 and 5000 RPM.\r\n\tMade entirely of aluminum, it is extraordinarily powerful, yet lightweight.

The perfect 50:50 weight distribution creates optimal balance and showcases the advantage of a rear–wheel–drive layout in a front-engine vehicle. By pairing rear–wheel drive with Giulia Quadrifoglio’s front–mounted, all–aluminum 6–cylinder engine, the Alfa Romeo engineering team was able to carefully distribute weight throughout the chassis.\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\t\r\n\tThe Giulia Quadrifoglio is equipped with an innovative system that ensures the optimal distribution of torque to the two rear shafts, thanks to an electronically controlled differential featuring two clutches.

The production models from the BMW M Performance Automobiles range are already incredibly sporty. Because of this, we did not have to make many modifications in order to get the BMW M235i Coupé up and running as a racing car. BMW Motorsport can look back on a long tradition of allowing ambitious teams and drivers an affordable way into motor racing – and of offering them an absolutely competitive car. That was the case recently with the BMW M3 GT4, and that is now being superseded with the BMW M235i Racing.\u003c/br\u003e\u003c/br\u003e\r\n\t\r\nThe motorsport genes are also easily recognisable in the production version of the BMW M235i Coupé, courtesy of the aerodynamically optimised body design. It is propelled by the most powerful petrol engine developed so far for a BMW M Performance Automobile, a six-cylinder in-line engine with M Performance TwinPower Turbo technology. With a capacity of 2,979ccm, the racing version is capable of generating 333hp\u003c/br\u003e\u003c/br\u003e\r\n\r\nMotorsport-specific driving aids such as ABS, DSC and traction control ensure that the motorsport newcomers can also handle the BMW M235i Racing surely and safely.

As before, the race car and the Z06 will share the same, production-based aluminum frame. By leveraging advanced manufacturing materials - such as laser welding, Flowdrill-machined fasteners and a GM-patented aluminum spot-welding process - the production structure is significantly stronger than its predecessor. For Corvette Racing, this equates to a race chassis for the C7.R that is 40 percent stronger than the outgoing C6.R.\u003c/br\u003e\u003c/br\u003e\r\n\t\r\n\tThe addition of direct fuel injection to the Corvette Z06 will enable the technology to return to a Corvette race car for the first time since the end of the GT1 era in 2009. It promises greater efficiency, which can make a significant difference in long-distance endurance racing such as Daytona and Le Mans through fewer time-consuming pit stops.\u003c/br\u003e\u003c/br\u003e\r\n\t\r\n\tThe aerodynamic strategies of the Corvette Stingray came directly from the Corvette C6.R - including the forward-tilted radiator, functional hood and front-quarter panel vents, and rear transmission and differential cooling intakes. The Z06 and C7.R take that aerodynamic foundation to the next level, sharing aggressive strategies for increased cooling and aerodynamic downforce, including similar front splitters, rocker panels, and front- and rear-brake cooling ducts.\r\n\t","tags":["#GTE-GT3","rwd","sequential","race","gt","gt2","usa"],"class":"race","specs":{"bhp":"495+bhp","torque":"650+Nm","weight":"1320kg","topspeed":"280+km/h","acceleration":"--s 0-100","pwratio":"2.66kg/hp"},"torqueCurve":[["0","0"],["500","293"],["1000","328"],["1500","527"],["2000","571"],["2500","581"],["3000","627"],["3500","658"],["4000","668"],["4500","675"],["5000","677"],["5500","645"],["6000","594"],["6500","539"],["7000","480"]],"powerCurve":[["0","0"],["500","21"],["1000","46"],["1500","111"],["2000","160"],["2500","204"],["3000","264"],["3500","323"],["4000","375"],["4500","427"],["5000","475"],["5500","498"],["6000","500"],["6500","492"],["7000","472"]],"path":"file:///C:/Program%20Files%20(x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/assettocorsa/content/cars/ks_corvette_c7r","id":"ks_corvette_c7r","badge":"file:///C:/Program%20Files%20(x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/assettocorsa/content/cars/ks_corvette_c7r/ui/badge.png","preview":"file:///C:/Program%20Files%20(x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/assettocorsa/content/cars/ks_corvette_c7r/ui/dlc_preview.png","dlc":true,"skins":[],"skinmeta":{}},"ks_corvette_c7_stingray":{"name":"Chevrolet Corvette C7 Stingray","brand":"Chevrolet","description":"And only a Corvette with the perfect balance of technology, design and performance can wear the iconic Stingray designation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\r\nThe Corvette Stingray features an estimated 450 horsepower and 610 Nm of torque, and it is able to accelerate from 0-60 in less than four seconds and achieve more than 1g in cornering grip.

Its design pioneered and popularized the wedge-shaped, sharply angled look popular in many high-performance sports cars. It also popularized the \"cabin-forward\" design concept, which pushes the passenger compartment forward to accommodate a larger engine. The word \"countach\" is an exclamation of astonishment in the local Piedmontese language.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nThe Countach\u0027s styling and visual impression made it an icon of great design to almost everyone except automotive engineers. The superior performance characteristics of later Lamborghini models (such as the Diablo, or the Murciélago) appealed to performance car drivers and engineers, but they never had the originality or outrageousness that gave the Countach its distinction.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nThe Countach entered production as the LP400 with a 3929 cc engine delivering 375 metric horsepower (370 hp) .In 1978, a new LP400 S model was introduced. Though the engine was slightly downgraded from the LP400 model (355 metric horsepower (350 bhp)), the most radical changes were in the exterior. 1982 saw another improvement, this time giving a bigger, more powerful 4754 cc engine.\u003cbr\u003e\r\nIn 1985 the engine was improved again, bored and stroked to 5167 cc and given four valves per cylinder (\"quattrovalvole\" in Italian), hence the model\u0027s name, Countach 5000 Quattrovalvole or 5000 QV in short. The carburetors were moved from the sides to the top of the engine for better breathing—unfortunately this created a hump on the engine deck, reducing the already poor rear visibility to almost nothing. Some body panels were also replaced by Kevlar. In later versions of the engine, the carburetors were replaced with fuel injection. Although this change was the most notable on the exterior, the most prominent change under the hood was the introduction of fuel injection.","tags":["#Vintage Supercars","rwd","manual","street","supercar","vintage","italy"],"class":"street","specs":{"bhp":"442bhp","torque":"500Nm","weight":"1490kg","topspeed":"295km/h","acceleration":"5.6s 0-100","pwratio":"3,34kg/hp","range":420},"torqueCurve":[["0","0"],["500","173"],["1000","252"],["1500","400"],["2000","400"],["2500","418"],["3000","442"],["3500","451"],["4000","468"],["4500","486"],["5000","494"],["5200","500"],["5500","499"],["6000","490"],["6500","478"],["7000","463"],["7500","420"],["8000","350"]],"powerCurve":[["0","0"],["500","12"],["1000","35"],["1500","84"],["2000","112"],["2500","147"],["3000","186"],["3500","222"],["4000","263"],["4500","307"],["5000","347"],["5200","365"],["5500","385"],["6000","413"],["6500","436"],["7000","455"],["7500","442"],["8000","393"]],"path":"file:///C:/Program%20Files%20(x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/assettocorsa/content/cars/ks_lamborghini_countach","id":"ks_lamborghini_countach","badge":"file:///C:/Program%20Files%20(x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/assettocorsa/content/cars/ks_lamborghini_countach/ui/badge.png","preview":"file:///C:/Program%20Files%20(x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/assettocorsa/content/cars/ks_lamborghini_countach/ui/dlc_preview.png","dlc":true,"skins":[],"skinmeta":{}},"ks_lamborghini_countach_s1":{"dlc":true,"id":"ks_lamborghini_countach_s1","name":"ks_lamborghini_countach_s1","description":"No car data available.","noJSON":true,"brand":"unknown","tags":[],"class":"unknown","skins":[],"skinmeta":{}},"ks_lamborghini_gallardo_sl":{"url":"http://store.steampowered.com/dlc/244210","name":"Lamborghini Gallardo SL","brand":"Lamborghini","description":"Even more dynamic, lighter, more powerful and stunning - the Lamborghini Gallardo LP 570-4 Superleggera is the new top model in the Gallardo line-up.

The overall shape of the car was innovative too, resembling a wedge on wheels which was inspired by the earlier Lotus 56 gas turbine car, and the layout taken from the Lotus 63 four wheel drive project testbed. The shape made for better air penetration and higher speeds. In a back-to-back test with the Lotus 49, the 72 was 12 mph faster with the same Cosworth engine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\r\nChapman\u0027s efforts produced one of the most remarkable and successful designs in F1 history. Taking the stressed engine layout technique from the Lotus 49 and adding advanced aerodynamics produced a car that was years ahead of its rivals. To begin with however, problems with the handling of the car had to be overcome, due to a lack of \u0027feel\u0027 caused by the anti-dive suspension geometry - which was designed to prevent the nose of the car dipping significantly under braking - and the anti-squat set-up at the rear, which was supposed to stop the car \u0027squatting down\u0027 under acceleration. Once the suspension was modified, there were no further problems. The car caused a sensation amongst the media and fans, with many people clamouring to see the remarkable car in action.","tags":["#Lotus72D","rwd","race","manual","gp","singleseater","vintage","great britain"],"class":"race","specs":{"bhp":"440bhp","torque":"332Nm","weight":"550kg","topspeed":"--km/h","acceleration":"--s 0-100","pwratio":"1.25kg/hp"},"torqueCurve":[["500","32"],["1000","99"],["1250","104"],["1500","108"],["1750","115"],["2000","122"],["2250","131"],["2500","140"],["2750","150"],["3000","161"],["3250","170"],["3500","183"],["3750","197"],["4000","211"],["4250","224"],["4500","234"],["4750","245"],["5000","255"],["5250","266"],["5500","275"],["5750","283"],["6000","290"],["6250","300"],["6500","317"],["6750","322"],["7000","325"],["7250","328"],["7500","330"],["7750","331"],["8000","330"],["8250","332"],["8500","332"],["8750","332"],["9000","332"],["9250","330"],["9500","328"],["9750","326"],["10000","318"],["10250","309"],["10500","299"],["10750","291"],["11000","281"],["11250","271"],["11500","262"],["11750","253"],["12000","241"]],"powerCurve":[["500","2"],["1000","14"],["1250","18"],["1500","23"],["1750","28"],["2000","34"],["2250","41"],["2500","49"],["2750","58"],["3000","68"],["3250","78"],["3500","90"],["3750","104"],["4000","119"],["4250","134"],["4500","148"],["4750","163"],["5000","179"],["5250","196"],["5500","212"],["5750","229"],["6000","244"],["6250","263"],["6500","289"],["6750","305"],["7000","319"],["7250","334"],["7500","348"],["7750","360"],["8000","371"],["8250","385"],["8500","396"],["8750","408"],["9000","420"],["9250","429"],["9500","438"],["9750","446"],["10000","447"],["10250","445"],["10500","441"],["10750","439"],["11000","434"],["11250","428"],["11500","423"],["11750","417"],["12000","406"]],"path":"file:///C:/Program%20Files%20(x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/assettocorsa/content/cars/ks_lotus_72d","id":"ks_lotus_72d","badge":"file:///C:/Program%20Files%20(x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/assettocorsa/content/cars/ks_lotus_72d/ui/badge.png","preview":"file:///C:/Program%20Files%20(x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/assettocorsa/content/cars/ks_lotus_72d/ui/dlc_preview.png","dlc":true,"skins":[],"skinmeta":{}},"ks_maserati_250f_12cyl":{"url":"http://store.steampowered.com/app/493190","name":"Maserati 250F 12 cylinder","brand":"Maserati","description":"The Maserati 250F took part of Formula One racing between January 1954 and November 1960, when rules allowed 2.5 liter unsupercharged or 750 cc supercharged engines.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\tMaserati went with the former, chosing a straight six aspirated engine configuration;

The C9 was able to win all but one race in the 1989 season, including the 24 Hours of Le Mans. \u003c/br\u003e\u003c/br\u003e \r\n\t\r\n\tThe car had two variations. The LM version, depicted here, had reduced downforce for less drag and was able to achieve great top speeds at the long straights of the Le Mans circuit.During qualifying for Le Mans, the C9 recorded a speed of 398 km/h on the Mulsanne Straight, a record. Mercedes driver Jean-Louis Schlesser would end up taking the driver\u0027s championship that season. \u003c/br\u003e\u003c/br\u003e \r\n\r\n\tThe M119 engine could use just 50% of total boost and still produce more than 710bhp with low fuel consumption, very important for the 24 hours race. Alternatively you can crack the turbo boost to 100% and get a power output of more than 900bhp but at the expense of reliability.\u003c/br\u003e\u003c/br\u003e \r\n\r\n\tThe car had very high levels of downforce, even in the LM low drag version. The downforce was generated by a very big diffuser and under tray, but this also caused the car to be very pitch sensitive. Very stiff suspension was needed to make the car more stable aerodynamically, but the combination of the suspension setup with the diffuser stall at low speeds and the impressive amounts of torque of the turbo charged engine at low revs, make a car easy to spin at slow turns. Careful throttle application is advised.\r\n\t","tags":["#Proto C","rwd","race","sequential","gt","prototype C","vintage","germany"],"class":"race","specs":{"bhp":"750+bhp","torque":"500Nm","weight":"905kg","topspeed":"380+km/h","acceleration":"--s 0-100","pwratio":"1.20kg/hp","range":185},"torqueCurve":[["0","200"],["500","363"],["1000","371"],["1500","383"],["2000","472"],["2500","594"],["3000","775"],["3500","784"],["4000","792"],["4500","800"],["5000","800"],["5500","810"],["6000","793"],["6500","775"],["7000","731"],["7500","657"]],"powerCurve":[["0","0"],["500","25"],["1000","52"],["1500","81"],["2000","133"],["2500","209"],["3000","326"],["3500","385"],["4000","445"],["4500","506"],["5000","562"],["5500","626"],["6000","668"],["6500","707"],["7000","719"],["7500","692"]],"path":"file:///C:/Program%20Files%20(x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/assettocorsa/content/cars/ks_mercedes_c9","id":"ks_mercedes_c9","badge":"file:///C:/Program%20Files%20(x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/assettocorsa/content/cars/ks_mercedes_c9/ui/badge.png","preview":"file:///C:/Program%20Files%20(x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/assettocorsa/content/cars/ks_mercedes_c9/ui/dlc_preview.png","dlc":true,"skins":[],"skinmeta":{}},"ks_nissan_370z":{"url":"http://store.steampowered.com/app/467980","name":"Nissan 370z Nismo","brand":"Nissan","description":"Though it has now been 45 years since the arrival of the original 240Z, its influence remains strong in the sports car world and in the design of the current generation 370Z Coupe.

The designation for the new generation of models is 718 Boxster and 718 Boxster S. This way, Porsche continues the tradition of the four-cylinder flat engines that were used in the Porsche 718 mid-engine sports cars that won numerous races back in the 1950s and 1960s, among them being the legendary Targa Florio and Le Mans.\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nThe centrepiece of the new model series is the newly developed four-cylinder flat engine with turbocharging - the first time since the late 1960s that Porsche is again implementing sports cars with this type of engine. The 718 Boxster S develops 257 kW (350 hp) from 2.5 litres of displacement. In the S-model, Porsche also uses a turbocharger with variable turbine geometry. In fact Porsche is now the only manufacturer to offer VTG technology in production cars with petrol-driven engines, both in the 911 Turbo and in the 718 Boxster S.\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nTurbocharging significantly boosts torque. The 2.5-litre engine of the 718 Boxster S attains 420 Newton metres over a speed range from 1,900 rpm to 4,500 rpm, which also leads to a faster sprint performance.

The designation for the new generation of models is 718 Boxster and 718 Boxster S. This way, Porsche continues the tradition of the four-cylinder flat engines that were used in the Porsche 718 mid-engine sports cars that won numerous races back in the 1950s and 1960s, among them being the legendary Targa Florio and Le Mans.\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nThe centrepiece of the new model series is the newly developed four-cylinder flat engine with turbocharging - the first time since the late 1960s that Porsche is again implementing sports cars with this type of engine. The 718 Boxster S develops 257 kW (350 hp) from 2.5 litres of displacement. In the S-model, Porsche also uses a turbocharger with variable turbine geometry. In fact Porsche is now the only manufacturer to offer VTG technology in production cars with petrol-driven engines, both in the 911 Turbo and in the 718 Boxster S.\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nTurbocharging significantly boosts torque. The 2.5-litre engine of the 718 Boxster S attains 420 Newton metres over a speed range from 1,900 rpm to 4,500 rpm, which also leads to a faster sprint performance. The 718 Boxster S – with Porsche Doppelkupplungsgetriebe (PDK) and Sport Chrono Package – sprints from zero to 100 km/h in 4.2 seconds.

The tremendous torque of the new engine promises driving fun and agility even at low revs. The 2.5-litre engine of the 718 Cayman S features a turbocharger with variable turbine geometry (VTG), a technology hitherto used exclusively in the 911 Turbo. It delivers up to 420 Nm (an extra 50 Nm) to the crankshaft at engine speeds between 1,900 and 4,500 rpm. For the driver this means even better torque in all engine speed ranges.

Lateral rigidity and wheel tracking have been improved in the completely retuned chassis; springs and stabilisers have been designed to be firmer and the tuning of the shock absorbers has been revised. The steering, which has been configured to be ten per cent more direct, enhances agility and driving fun.

Overall victory at the 44th Targa Florio in 1960 also went to Porsche, when Joakim Bonnier and Hans Hermann crossed the finish line with a lead of more than six minutes over the three-litre Ferrari. Second place in the 1000 kilometres of Nürburgring completed its triumphant run. With the Swiss racing driver, Heini Walter, at the wheel, the 718 RS proved its climbing qualities by consecutively winning the third and fourth European Hill Climb Championships in 1960 and 1961.","tags":["#Vintage Touring","rwd","manual","race","vintage","germany"],"class":"race","specs":{"bhp":"150hp","torque":"148Nm","weight":"580kg","topspeed":"230km/h","acceleration":"--s 0-100","pwratio":"3.8kg/hp"},"torqueCurve":[["500","89"],["1000","110"],["1500","116"],["2000","118"],["2500","121"],["3000","117"],["3500","122"],["4000","129"],["4500","135"],["5000","137"],["5500","147"],["6000","144"],["6500","140"],["7000","142"],["7500","139"],["7800","138"],["8000","129"],["8100","112"]],"powerCurve":[["500","6"],["1000","15"],["1500","24"],["2000","33"],["2500","42"],["3000","49"],["3500","60"],["4000","72"],["4500","85"],["5000","96"],["5500","114"],["6000","121"],["6500","128"],["7000","140"],["7500","146"],["7800","151"],["8000","145"],["8100","127"]],"path":"file:///C:/Program%20Files%20(x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/assettocorsa/content/cars/ks_porsche_718_spyder_rs","id":"ks_porsche_718_spyder_rs","badge":"file:///C:/Program%20Files%20(x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/assettocorsa/content/cars/ks_porsche_718_spyder_rs/ui/badge.png","preview":"file:///C:/Program%20Files%20(x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/assettocorsa/content/cars/ks_porsche_718_spyder_rs/ui/dlc_preview.png","dlc":true,"skins":[],"skinmeta":{}},"ks_porsche_908_lh":{"url":"http://store.steampowered.com/dlc/540711","name":"Porsche 908 LH","brand":"Porsche","description":"The 908 debut came in the Monza 1000km race on April 25 1968.\r\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \r\n\tIn September of the same year it was driven at the 24 Hours of Le Mans: here the 908s were the fastest cars in qualifying and the early stages of the race, however, unlucky for them the repair rules were misinterpreted by Porsche team leaders, resulting in their disqualification.\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \r\nThings went better in next year\u0027s race: although Jacky Ickx won in a Ford GT40, Hans Herrmann\u0027 908 LH finished in 2nd place, just a few seconds behind due to a brake pad issue towards the end of the race. \r\n","tags":["#Vintage GT","rwd","manual","vintage","race","germany"],"class":"race","specs":{"bhp":"350bhp","torque":"320Nm","weight":"650kg","topspeed":"320km/h","acceleration":"--s 0-100","pwratio":"1.85kg/hp"},"torqueCurve":[["500","134"],["1000","144"],["1500","151"],["2000","151"],["2500","153"],["3000","167"],["3500","172"],["4000","181"],["4500","198"],["4750","216"],["5000","247"],["5500","297"],["6000","308"],["6600","319"],["7000","316"],["7500","314"],["8000","308"],["8500","293"],["8600","292"],["9000","200"]],"powerCurve":[["500","9"],["1000","20"],["1500","32"],["2000","42"],["2500","54"],["3000","70"],["3500","85"],["4000","102"],["4500","125"],["4750","144"],["5000","173"],["5500","229"],["6000","260"],["6600","296"],["7000","311"],["7500","331"],["8000","346"],["8500","350"],["8600","353"],["9000","253"]],"path":"file:///C:/Program%20Files%20(x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/assettocorsa/content/cars/ks_porsche_908_lh","id":"ks_porsche_908_lh","badge":"file:///C:/Program%20Files%20(x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/assettocorsa/content/cars/ks_porsche_908_lh/ui/badge.png","preview":"file:///C:/Program%20Files%20(x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/assettocorsa/content/cars/ks_porsche_908_lh/ui/dlc_preview.png","dlc":true,"skins":[],"skinmeta":{}},"ks_porsche_911_carrera_rsr":{"url":"http://store.steampowered.com/app/526060","name":"Porsche 911 Carrera RSR 3.0","brand":"Porsche","description":"\r\n\tWhen choosing the most exciting 911 of all time, the Porsche 911 Carrera RSR would come out on top.

It is equipped with the maximum degree of motorsport technology that is currently possible in a street-legal 911. With a lap time of seven minutes and 20 seconds, the 911 GT3 RS even beats the historic record value of the Carrera GT super sports car of just under seven minutes and 29 seconds on the North Loop of the Nürburgring.\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nMotorsport expertise is the reason for this superior performance. The 911 GT3 RS is powered by a four-litre six-cylinder engine with 500 hp (368 kW) of power and 460 Newton metres of torque, combined with a specially developed PDK transmission. The engine, which has the largest displacement and most power of any naturally aspirated engine with direct fuel injection in the 911 family, accelerates the high-performance sports car from zero to 100 km/h in 3.3 seconds and to 200 km/h in 10.9 seconds.\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nThe 911 GT3 RS is a masterpiece of intelligent lightweight design. For the first time, the roof is made of magnesium; carbon fibre is used for the engine and luggage compartment lids, and other lightweight components are made of alternative materials. In addition, the lightweight roof lowers the sports car\u0027s centre of gravity which improves its excellent lateral dynamics. The body comes from the 911 Turbo, and it signifies its status as nearly a race car driving machine with its RS-specific aerodynamic add-on parts. The front spoiler lip, which extends nearly to the road, and the large rear wing reinforce its dominant look. \r\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nAnother characteristic is the unique front wheel arch air vents that extend into the upper section of the wings – just as in purebred motorsport cars. They increase downforce at the front axle. \r\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nThe chassis of the 911 GT3 RS has been tuned for maximum driving dynamics and precision. Rear-axle steering and Porsche Torque Vectoring Plus with fully variable rear axle differential lock increase agility and dynamics, and the wider front and rear track widths enable a superior roll stability. In addition, the 911 GT3 RS comes with the widest tyres of any 911 model as standard. The results: even more agile turn-in characteristics and even higher cornering speeds. \r\n","tags":["#Supercars","rwd","semiautomatic","street","trackday","supercar","germany"],"class":"street","specs":{"bhp":"500hp","torque":"460Nm","weight":"1420kg","topspeed":"310km/h","acceleration":"3.1s 0-100","pwratio":"2.84kg/hp"},"torqueCurve":[["500","150"],["1000","240"],["1500","278"],["2000","319"],["2500","331"],["3000","340"],["3500","344"],["4000","352"],["4500","401"],["5000","418"],["5500","443"],["6000","458"],["6250","460"],["6500","459"],["6750","456"],["7000","459"],["7500","450"],["8000","439"],["8250","432"],["8500","408"],["9000","379"]],"powerCurve":[["500","11"],["1000","34"],["1500","59"],["2000","90"],["2500","116"],["3000","143"],["3500","169"],["4000","198"],["4500","253"],["5000","293"],["5500","342"],["6000","386"],["6250","404"],["6500","419"],["6750","432"],["7000","451"],["7500","474"],["8000","493"],["8250","500"],["8500","487"],["9000","479"]],"path":"file:///C:/Program%20Files%20(x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/assettocorsa/content/cars/ks_porsche_911_gt3_rs","id":"ks_porsche_911_gt3_rs","badge":"file:///C:/Program%20Files%20(x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/assettocorsa/content/cars/ks_porsche_911_gt3_rs/ui/badge.png","preview":"file:///C:/Program%20Files%20(x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/assettocorsa/content/cars/ks_porsche_911_gt3_rs/ui/dlc_preview.png","dlc":true,"skins":[],"skinmeta":{}},"ks_porsche_911_gt3_r_2016":{"url":"http://store.steampowered.com/dlc/540711","name":"Porsche 911 GT3 R 2016","brand":"Porsche","description":"\r\n\tBased on the 911 GT3 RS production sports car, the 911 GT3 R has been designed as customer sport race car for GT3 series around the world.\r\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\tIn developing the more than 368 kW (500 hp) racing nine-eleven, special attention was paid to lightweight design, better aerodynamic efficiency, reducing consumption, improved handling, further optimised safety as well as lowering service and spare parts costs.\r\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\tThe lightweight body design of the 911 GT3 RS production sports car featuring intelligent aluminium-steel composite construction has proven to be the ideal basis for the race car and its cutting-edge four-litre flat-six unit is largely identical to the high-performance production engine of the road-legal model.\r\n\t","tags":["#GTE-GT3","rwd","race","sequential","gt","gt3","germany"],"class":"race","specs":{"bhp":"500hp","torque":"--Nm","weight":"--kg","topspeed":"--km/h","acceleration":"--s 0-100","pwratio":"--kg/hp"},"torqueCurve":[["500","150"],["1000","240"],["1500","278"],["2000","319"],["2500","331"],["3000","330"],["3500","334"],["4000","342"],["4500","381"],["5000","428"],["5500","453"],["6000","468"],["6250","480"],["6500","479"],["6750","486"],["7000","479"],["7500","470"],["8000","469"],["8250","462"],["8500","438"],["9000","409"]],"powerCurve":[["500","11"],["1000","34"],["1500","59"],["2000","90"],["2500","116"],["3000","139"],["3500","164"],["4000","192"],["4500","241"],["5000","301"],["5500","350"],["6000","394"],["6250","421"],["6500","437"],["6750","461"],["7000","471"],["7500","495"],["8000","527"],["8250","535"],["8500","523"],["9000","517"]],"path":"file:///C:/Program%20Files%20(x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/assettocorsa/content/cars/ks_porsche_911_gt3_r_2016","id":"ks_porsche_911_gt3_r_2016","badge":"file:///C:/Program%20Files%20(x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/assettocorsa/content/cars/ks_porsche_911_gt3_r_2016/ui/badge.png","preview":"file:///C:/Program%20Files%20(x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/assettocorsa/content/cars/ks_porsche_911_gt3_r_2016/ui/dlc_preview.png","dlc":true,"skins":[],"skinmeta":{}},"ks_porsche_911_r":{"url":"http://store.steampowered.com/dlc/540711","name":"Porsche 911 R","brand":"Porsche","description":"\r\n\tThe chassis of the new 911 R is based on the 911 GT3 and provides extremely sporty day-to-day driving.

The V8 engine is coupled to the hybrid module, which comprises a 115 kW electric motor and a decoupler that serves as the connection with the combustion engine. An additional electric motor with 95 kW drives the front axle. Because of its parallel hybrid configuration, the 918 Spyder can be powered at the rear axle either individually by the combustion engine or electric motors or via both drives jointly, thus giving it a total power of 887 hp (652 kW). The sprint from 0 to 100 km/h is performed within 2.6 seconds, and the top speed is reached at 345 km/h.\r\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\tThe car has an unladen weight of approximately 1,640 kg, an excellent low weight for a hybrid vehicle of this performance class. The drivetrain components and all components weighing over 50 kg are located as low and as centrally as possible within the vehicle. This results in a slightly rear end biased axle load distribution of 57 per cent on the rear axle and 43 per cent on the front axle, combined with an extremely low centre of gravity at approximately the height of the wheel hubs, which is ideal for driving dynamics. \r\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\tAll of this serves to give the 918 Spyder a superior performance on the racetrack. As the first vehicle to boast global road homologation, the 918 Spyder has conquered the 20.6-kilometre lap around the Nürburgring Nordschleife in less than seven minutes. Achieving a time of exactly six minutes and 57 seconds, the super sportscar shaved an incredible 14 seconds off the previous record.\r\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\tThe 918 Spyder continues a long tradition of super sports cars at Porsche: as technology platforms, as the driving force behind both car emotion and car evolution and as the ultimate sports cars of their decades.\r\n\t","tags":["#Hypercars","awd","street","semiautomatic","germany"],"class":"street","specs":{"bhp":"887bhp","torque":"1275Nm","weight":"1640kg","topspeed":"345km/h","acceleration":"2.6s 0-100","pwratio":"1.84kg/hp"},"torqueCurve":[["500","561"],["1000","686"],["1500","755"],["2000","790"],["2500","826"],["3000","864"],["3500","875"],["4000","905"],["4500","905"],["5000","888"],["5500","851"],["6000","849"],["6500","838"],["6700","841"],["7000","819"],["7500","786"],["8000","765"],["8500","745"],["8700","727"],["9000","690"],["9150","657"]],"powerCurve":[["500","39"],["1000","96"],["1500","159"],["2000","222"],["2500","290"],["3000","364"],["3500","430"],["4000","508"],["4500","572"],["5000","624"],["5500","657"],["6000","715"],["6500","765"],["6700","791"],["7000","805"],["7500","828"],["8000","859"],["8500","889"],["8700","888"],["9000","872"],["9150","844"]],"path":"file:///C:/Program%20Files%20(x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/assettocorsa/content/cars/ks_porsche_918_spyder","id":"ks_porsche_918_spyder","badge":"file:///C:/Program%20Files%20(x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/assettocorsa/content/cars/ks_porsche_918_spyder/ui/badge.png","preview":"file:///C:/Program%20Files%20(x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/assettocorsa/content/cars/ks_porsche_918_spyder/ui/dlc_preview.png","dlc":true,"skins":[],"skinmeta":{}},"ks_porsche_919_hybrid_2015":{"url":"http://store.steampowered.com/app/540710","name":"Porsche 919 Hybrid 2015","brand":"Porsche","description":"\r\nThe WEC regulations lay down strict requirements relating to efficiency, safety and sustainability in motorsports.

The highlight of this development project was the legendary Porsche 935/78 from 1978 – the most powerful 911 of all time. The differences between this powerhouse - named \"Moby Dick\" on account of its wide, long-tailed body - and previous models were a modified frame, aerodynamically enhanced body and right-hand drive, among other things. With the aim of improving the performance and durability of the engine, the Weissach engineers developed a power unit that was destined to leave the competition standing. As previous models had encountered problems with cylinder head maintenance, these were now simply welded together. A compromise also had to be found for the cooling. So water cooled the heads, and air cooled the cylinders. With the newly-introduced four-valve technology, the six-cylinder horizontally opposed engine relied on two intercooled turbochargers. Increasing the displacement to 3,211 cm³ resulted in brute power of 845 hp. Due to its continued dominance, Porsche withdrew from the long-distance World Championship in 1978, meaning that \"Moby Dick\" saw only a handful of outings. At Le Mans, the race car managed an incredible 366 km/h on the Mulsanne Straight, but in the end its drivers, Manfred Schurti and Rolf Stommelen, only finished in eighth place, due to technical problems. The great successes of the Porsche 935/78 were not achieved until 1978 onwards, as part of the private Kremer team. \r\n\t","tags":["#Vintage Supercars","manual","turbo","vintage","race","Le Mans","germany"],"class":"race","specs":{"bhp":"845bhp","torque":"784Nm","weight":"1025kg","topspeed":"366km/h","acceleration":"2.6s 0-100","pwratio":"1.21kg/hp"},"torqueCurve":[["500","104"],["750","110"],["1000","116"],["1250","122"],["1500","128"],["1750","144"],["2000","140"],["2250","156"],["2500","157"],["2750","158"],["3000","160"],["3250","171"],["3500","176"],["3750","182"],["4000","188"],["4250","190"],["4500","237"],["4750","308"],["5000","361"],["5250","447"],["5500","529"],["5750","601"],["6000","682"],["6250","719"],["6500","781"],["6600","784"],["7000","783"],["7250","769"],["7500","755"],["7750","741"],["8000","727"],["8200","716"],["8500","685"],["8750","654"],["9000","623"],["9250","592"],["9500","522"]],"powerCurve":[["500","7"],["750","12"],["1000","16"],["1250","21"],["1500","27"],["1750","35"],["2000","39"],["2250","49"],["2500","55"],["2750","61"],["3000","67"],["3250","78"],["3500","87"],["3750","96"],["4000","106"],["4250","113"],["4500","150"],["4750","205"],["5000","253"],["5250","330"],["5500","409"],["5750","485"],["6000","575"],["6250","631"],["6500","713"],["6600","727"],["7000","770"],["7250","783"],["7500","795"],["7750","806"],["8000","817"],["8200","824"],["8500","818"],["8750","804"],["9000","787"],["9250","769"],["9500","696"]],"path":"file:///C:/Program%20Files%20(x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/assettocorsa/content/cars/ks_porsche_935_78_moby_dick","id":"ks_porsche_935_78_moby_dick","badge":"file:///C:/Program%20Files%20(x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/assettocorsa/content/cars/ks_porsche_935_78_moby_dick/ui/badge.png","preview":"file:///C:/Program%20Files%20(x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/assettocorsa/content/cars/ks_porsche_935_78_moby_dick/ui/dlc_preview.png","dlc":true,"skins":[],"skinmeta":{}},"ks_porsche_962c_longtail":{"url":"http://store.steampowered.com/app/540710","name":"Porsche 962 C Long Tail","brand":"Porsche","description":"\r\nFirst developed in 1984 for use in the USA, from 1985 the Porsche 962 C continued the successful global motorsport story begun by its predecessor model, the 956, in 1982.

Toyota added their D-4S injection system which uses both direct and port injection.

Following the presentation of the car, Glickenhaus proposed Paolo Garella, who in the meanwhile had become an independent consultant, to produce a second prototype intended for races. With the design and manufacturing contribution of an important name in the racing world, L.M. di Gianetti, the P4/5 Competizione Project was engineered under Paolo Garella\u0027s supervision and in 2011, the car, developed from a Ferrari 430 Scuderia and a Ferrari 430 GT2, arrived on the scene showing a vintage automotive spirit combining passion and competence, craftsmanship and industrial culture. Since the very first competitions, the whole P4/5 Competizione team, managed by Scuderia Cameron-Glickenhaus, has been showing a spirit returning authenticity to motor racing, focusing the attention both on the sports challenge itself, but also on sharing, through social networks, this unique experience with fans all over the world.\u003c/br\u003e\u003c/br\u003e\r\n\t\r\n\t2011 Nürburgring 24 Hours\u003c/br\u003e\r\n\tPrior to the 24 Hours, the P4/5C contested two earlier six-hour races on the Nürburgring track to give former F1 greats Mika Salo and Nicola Larini, British Touring Car champion Fabrizio Giovanardi, and seasoned Nürburgring veteran Luca Cappellari a taste of what was to come. During the 24 Hours, the team showed to be determined, one way or another, to finish. When the checkered flag fell in bright sun at 4 p.m. Sunday, the P4/5C had covered 133 laps, finishing to 39th, nearly where it had started. The P4/5C, for its part, finished second in its class, the experimental E1-XP2 category. The Nürburgring organizers awarded the P4/5C a Constructor\u0027s Trophy for entering a new and significant car. Soon after the race, the P4/5 Competizione took a well-earned vacation by a one-month display in Turin\u0027s National Automobile Museum. \r\n","tags":["#GTE-GT3","rwd","race","sequential","gt","gt2","italy"],"class":"race","specs":{"bhp":"450bhp","torque":"500Nm","weight":"1230kg","topspeed":"260km/h","acceleration":"3.9s 0-100","pwratio":"2.62kg/hp","range":171},"torqueCurve":[["0","56"],["500","121"],["1000","153"],["1500","211"],["2000","269"],["2500","357"],["3000","378"],["3500","387"],["4000","418"],["4500","475"],["5000","463"],["5500","500"],["6000","483"],["6500","476"],["7000","452"],["7500","402"],["8000","371"],["8250","345"]],"powerCurve":[["0","0"],["500","8"],["1000","21"],["1500","44"],["2000","76"],["2500","125"],["3000","159"],["3500","190"],["4000","235"],["4500","300"],["5000","325"],["5500","395"],["6000","407"],["6500","434"],["7000","450"],["7500","423"],["8000","417"],["8250","400"]],"path":"file:///C:/Program%20Files%20(x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/assettocorsa/content/cars/p4-5_2011","id":"p4-5_2011","badge":"file:///C:/Program%20Files%20(x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/assettocorsa/content/cars/p4-5_2011/ui/badge.png","dlc":false,"skins":["2011"],"skinmeta":{"2011":{"skinName":null,"driverName":null,"country":null,"number":null,"team":null}}},"pagani_huayra":{"name":"Pagani Huayra","brand":"Pagani","description":"After seven years of hard work I am now able to tell you a little brief history and the path that led to the birth of the Huayra, project name C9.\u003c/br\u003e\u003c/br\u003e\r\n\tThe Huayra is made of more than 4000 components (engine and gearbox not included).

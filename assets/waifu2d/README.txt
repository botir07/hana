Drop your 2D VTuber sprites here to override the procedural avatar.

Supported layouts:
- idle/*.png
- listening/*.png
- thinking/*.png
- speaking/*.png
- error/*.png

Each folder should contain numbered PNG frames (00.png, 01.png...). If a folder is missing, the app uses the built-in stylized fallback.

Quick override:
- Put a single high-res PNG named `character.png` in this folder to use it as the base sprite for every state (no animation). Transparent background recommended.
